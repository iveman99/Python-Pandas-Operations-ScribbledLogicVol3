# 🐼 Scribbled Logic | Vol. 3: Pandas Operations  

> **"Making Data Speak — By Giving It Structure."**

---

### ✍️ Scribbled Logic — The Third Chapter  
> Before data starts predicting, it must learn to organize.  
> Pandas taught me the art of structuring raw chaos into readable, analyzable stories.  

After understanding the fundamentals of Python and NumPy,  
this volume dives deep into **Pandas** — the library that bridges logic and insight.  
Here, tables come alive, and datasets begin to **speak in rows and columns**.
